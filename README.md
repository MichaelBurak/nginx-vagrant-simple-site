# Provison a Web Server with Automation and Deploy a Website on it 
Project #1 in a series implementing a list of [Practical DevOps Project Ideas](https://www.tutorialworks.com/devops-project-ideas/)


## Introduction & Goals 
This is a simple project to:
- Create a virtual machine 
- Install a web server on the VM 
- Configure the server to serve up some basic HTML 
- Make the server accessible locally

## Technologies Used 
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) for provisioning a [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) VM 
- [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) for web server 

## Architecture Diagram (if any) / Infrastructure 
- Created infrastructure: a Ubuntu VM with Nginx web server

## How It Works (High-Level)
- Vagrant creates the VM, with Nginx serving up static content (an HTML hello world)
